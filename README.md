## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a full stack engineer with **12+ years** of professional experience building and owning production grade systems **end-to-end** from system design and architecture through deployment, user training and ongoing maintenance.

My background is unique. I've built enterprise systems **solo** that are currently live and used daily across **3 manufacturing companies** serving 500+ employees. I handle everything : backend, frontend, database design, API architecture, hardware integration and direct stakeholder collaboration.

**What I bring:**
- **End-to-end ownership** → I design, build, deploy, train, and maintain systems independently
- **Enterprise scale** → HR management, production monitoring, inventory systems, payroll automation
- **Multi-location architecture** → systems deployed across multiple companies from a single codebase
- **Business impact focus** → 80% payroll time reduction, 90% inventory discrepancy elimination, real-time operational visibility

**Currently seeking:** Tech Lead or Senior Full-Stack Engineer role in a **remote-first company** where I can lead engineering while contributing hands on to meaningful product development.
